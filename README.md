## 1.About this repo

This repo using python basic to crawl data in a website. Specifically, that website is a news website in Vietnam. You can use Colab or your jupyter Notebook or basic file .py to run this code. I used [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) as the main library to perform scratching.
