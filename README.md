# Crawl-Analyst-Data

## Hi, I'm Harly ðŸ˜…

Welcome to my repo. This is my project I was study by myself. I wanna share with you

## 1.About this repo

* This repo using python basic to crawl data in a website. Specifically, that website is a news website in Vietnam. You can use Colab or your jupyter Notebook or basic   file .py to run this code. I used [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) as the main library to perform scratching.

## 2.Basic crawl

* First, You can find any websites you want to get data. Easy to practice and no legal problems I think newspaper websites are suitable. After that you can crawl data, analyst data you have and and draw conclusions

* Second, I used chrome to crawl data. So if you will use chrome to get data, find a **chromedriver.exe** suitable for your version of chrome 

* After that, you fix a code to crawl your data in file getting_data.py or getting_data.ipynb if you use jupyter notebook

## 3. Run this code in repo

 * I crawled data on [BaoPhapLuatVietNam](https://baophapluat.vn).

  To crawled data on web
```
